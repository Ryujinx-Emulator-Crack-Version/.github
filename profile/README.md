**Keys**

When you launch Ryujinx for the first time, an error for missing components will pop up. To fix that, you need the prod.keys.

**Note**

Older keys are included. Download only the latest, and extract the archive using 7zip or WinRAR. If what you download also contains title.keys, delete it. It is not needed.

After downloading the keys, Open Ryujinx, go to the top left corner and click on "File" and then "Open Ryujinx folder". Open the system folder and put (only) the prod.keys file in that folder.

Restart Ryujinx and you shouldn't get the error anymore. If you still do, you messed up. Repeat the previous steps.
